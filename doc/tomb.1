.SH DESCRIPTION

Tomb is a  simple commandline tool for encrypted  storage and it comes
complete with programs to facilitate its operation by desktop users.

Tomb generates encrypted  storage files to be opened  and closed using
their associated  keyfiles, which are  also protected with  a password
chosen by the user.

A tomb  is like  a locked  folder that can  be safely  transported and
hidden in  a filesystem; its keys  can be kept  separate, for instance
keeping the tomb file on your computer harddisk and the key files on a
USB stick.

When specified,  \fIfile\fR is the name  of the tomb to  be created or
opened,  while \fImountpoint\fR  is  an existing  directory where  its
contents should be made accessible.

For simplified use, the command \fItomb-open\fR can be used to start a
wizard that guides users in the creation of a new tomb or, if the
\fIfile\fR argument is specified, to open a tomb and make it
accessible in a default location under the /media folder.

The other commands \fItomb-status\fR and \fItomb-askpass\fR are mostly
for internal  use (they are called  by tomb with  the right arguments)
and serve the purpose of communicating with the user via the graphical
interface.

The auxiliary programs \fI


.SH COMMANDS
.B
.IP "create"
Create a new encrypted storage \fIfile\fR and its keys
.B
.IP "open"
Opens an existing tomb \fIfile\fR. The \fImountpoint\fR where the tomb
will be  made accessible can  be specified, if  not the default  is to
create a directory named like the tomb inside /media.
.B
.IP "close"
Closes a currently open tomb.  When \fIfile\fR is specified, it should
point to the /dev/mapper name used to mount the tomb; if \fIfile\fR is
not specified  and only one tomb is  open, then it will  be closed; if
multiple tombs are open, the command will list them on the terminal.

.SH OPTIONS
.B
.B
.IP "-s \fI<MBytes>\fR" 
When creating a tomb, this option  must be used to specify the size of
the new \fIfile\fR to be created, in megabytes.
.B
.IP "-k \fI<keyfile>\fR"
When opening a  tomb, this option can be used  to specify the location
of the  key to use. Keys  are created with  the same name of  the tomb
file adding a '.gpg' suffix,  but can be later renamed and transported
on other media. When a key is  not found, the program asks to insert a
USB storage device and it will look for the key file inside it.
.B
.IP "-S"
The  tomb commandline  tool needs  to  acquire super  user rights  (to
become root) for  most of its operations. When  used, this option will
tell the tomb program to use 'sudo'  or 'gksu' to ask the user for the
password or use the one already in cache.
.B
.IP "-h"
Display a help text and quit
.B
.IP "-v"
Display version and quit
