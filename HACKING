Style guidelines
===============

Indentation
-----------
Code must be indented using four spaces.
In vim, this can be accomplished using

	set shiftwidth=4
	set expandtab

Naming
------

global variables should be `$UPPERCASE`.

local variables should be `$lowercase`, best if it can be written without underscores.
If you feel the need to name a variable `$longdescriptionofwhatthisisusefulfor`,
then you're allowed to use underscores. But do you really need?

functions should be lowercase+underscores: `do_this()`
