TODO and Roadmap for Tomb

you are welcome to send patches to jaromil@dyne.org

* TODO Release 1.0							:80%:

** DONE [#A] desktop integration the freedesktop way		    :jaromil:

** DONE [#A] use a posix thread instead of fork for status close    :jaromil:

** [#A] fix operation without DISPLAY (over SSH)		   :hellekin:

** [#A] use a config file to map bind mounts			    :jaromil:

 useful also to choose a default file browser and other things.

 using mount -o bind we can trigger actions to be made after mounting
 a tomb so that personal directories appear in the home folder.

** TODO [#A] SLAM tomb and kill all applications using it

   using fuser(1) we can do that easily, but we should ask user
   confirmation.

   now tomb-dialog or something like that would be useful it askpass
   and dialog might melt together into one binary later.

** DONE [#B] debian packaging with desktop integration		    :jaromil:

** [#B] incremental backup system using bup			    :jaromil:

   tombs are modifed only where needed so file changes are local to
   the file segment where data is stored. i've tested this idea and it
   works! bup makes incremental backups using git as a backend, big up

** TODO [#C] decorate creation wizard with ASCII art
