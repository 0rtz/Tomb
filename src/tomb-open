Create a new Tomb
=================

  A Tomb is  a special folder that keeps files  safe using a password:
  it makes use  of strong encryption and helps you keep  the keys on a
  separate USB storage for safer transports.

  Inside a Tomb  you can store private informations  without fear that
  other people  possessing it will discover your  secrets, unless they
  have your USB key and your password.

  If you choose  to proceed now, we'll guide  you through the creation
  of a new Tomb, You will also need the super-user (sudo) password for
  the computer you are using.

  If you will, I'll be your Crypto Undertaker.
  Do you want to proceed, Master? (yes/no)"

  Operation confirmed!  we will  now call the  undertaker to  do its
  job, but  in order  to do so  you will  need to provide  your sudo
  password:

    echo "  Well done!"
    echo "  Now the last thing to do is to install Tomb on your desktop:"
