	The first version of Tomb ever released to the public

During the year 2009

	Tomb has been extensively tested, perfectioned and documented
	after being used by its author

Sometime in 2007

	mknest was refactored to work on the Debian distribution and since
	then renamed to Tomb. dyne:bolic specific dependencies where
	removed, keeping Zsh as the shell script it is written with.

Back in 2005

	The "nesting" feature of dyne:bolic GNU/Linux lets users encrypt
	their home in a file, using a shell script and a graphical
	interface called Taschino.

	Taschino included a shell script wrapping cryptsetup to encrypt
	loopback mounted partitions with the algo AES-256 (cbc-essiv
	mode): this script was called 'mkNest' and its the ancestor of
	Tomb.
